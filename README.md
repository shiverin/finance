### CS50x Week 9 Finance App

For my CS50x Week 9 assignment, I developed a fully functional finance app using Python Flask for the backend. The app allows users to register, log in, view stock quotes, and manage their portfolio by executing buy and sell transactions. I applied basic HTML and CSS for the frontend and successfully linked the backend to a live PostgreSQL server hosted on Render. This integration enabled me to prototype the user registration and login functionalities, securely storing user data in the SQL database.
